<h1>Floyd Warshall Generator</h1>
This Python script uses the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph provided to the program in the form of an array of arrays. The program can do this on a pre-given graph, or can (semi) randomly generate a weighted graph of a desired size and perform the algorithm on that instead.
<h2>Usage</h2>
Simply run the .py file in the command line or in any integrated Python IDE and follow the requested program inputs

* Requires the numpy library
